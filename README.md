Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry Analysis for Analysis and Validation of the Origin of Commercially Sold Mackerel




An important part of maintaining a sustainable fishing industry in the United Kingdom is the independent verification that the 'British' fish products sold in UK supermarkets are sources from UK fisheries. One way in which we can determine the location a fish was caught in is to analyze the isotopic composition of the fish tissue.
The ratio of different carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes will differ depending on where a fish has lived, and as such it is possible to compare isotopic data from these products against publicly available reference data banks from fish caught in known locations. If the samples differ too much, it is likely that these supermarket products are fraudulently labeled. I undertook this assignment as part of a university module as part of a group, where I was tasked with statistical analysis of the data.


In this study, Mackerel products containing fillet tissue from suppliers Waitrose, John West, Sainsburyâ€™s and J&S Seafood were sampled. From these samples the ratios of Carbon stable isotopes 13C and 12C and Nitrogen stable isotopes 15N and 14N were determined using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS). Using R studio, these data were then compared against a reference stable isotope composition dataset using data sourced from four different studies containing isotopic composition data from fish caught in the Celtic Sea, North Sea, Barents Sea, Irish Sea, and the Icelandic Sea. After analyses of these datasets it was concluded that it is most likely that all the products sampled in the study contained exclusively fish caught in UK fisheries.
